            <p>Working for more than the last 10 years to develop the Acme Corporation business in Europe. Establishing new alliances and growing a portfolio of loyal clients from scratch.</p>
            <p>The main skill acquired in this position was the team leadership ability to manage a remote team of multidisciplinary professionals. Vision and strategic execution in complex environments.</p>
            <h3>Risk Analyst</h3>
            <ul class="resume-org">
                <li>Acme Bank</li>
              </ul>
            <p>After several years working in fields such as banking, marketing, and business development, I decided to take on the challenge of turning my career into one of my passions: technology.</p>
            <p>It was during the 2020 lockdown that I discovered —and demystified— software development. At the time I followed some Python and JavaScript courses on Treehouse and quickly fell in love with the magic of building solutions from scratch.</p>
